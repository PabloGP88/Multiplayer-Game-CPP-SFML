# .io-Style Tank Game  
**José Pablo González Poblette** — **Student ID: 2507739**

Final project for the module **CMP501 – Network Game Development** at **Abertay University, Scotland**.

This project is a multiplayer server–client game developed in **C++** using the **SFML** framework. The game follows an *.io-style* design and includes the following core mechanics:

- Movement using **WASD**
- Aiming with the **left and right arrow keys**
- Shooting with the **space bar**

The game world is procedurally generated using a random seed sent by the server to all connected clients. This guarantees a consistent world layout for every player, featuring environmental obstacles such as rocks, as well as interactive elements like health kits and ammo boxes to give a complete game enviroment for players to move and have fun!
